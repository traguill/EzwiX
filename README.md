## EzwiX 

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/mvx04od82typiqlp?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/traguill/ezwix)


A 3D game engine made from scratch, using as a reference the previous engine that I made [Ezwix Engine](https://github.com/traguill/Ezwix-Engine).

This time it will use DirectX instead of OpenGL.
